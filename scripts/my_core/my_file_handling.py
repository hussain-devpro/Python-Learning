# code_points are the character written to the file
# A code point is the atomic unit of information. Text is a sequence of code points.
# Each code point is a number which is given meaning by the Unicode standard.
# A code unit is the unit of storage of a part of an encoded code point. In UTF-8 this means 8-bits, in UTF-16 this
# means 16-bits. A single code unit may represent a full code point, or part of a code point. For example,
# the snowman glyph (â˜ƒ) is a single code point but 3 UTF-8 code units, and 1 UTF-16 code unit.
